        <summary class="question">What is Raindrop Technique? </summary>
         <p class="answer">
          The Raindrop Technique is a method of using a combination of reflexology, aromatherapy, massage techniques, and essential
          oils applied on your spine and on the feet. High quality essential oils are placed on the reflex points on the feet where 
          the spine is represented. The Raindrop Technique is designed to bring balance to the body with its relaxing and mild application.
          The Raindrop Technique is a gentle application of essential oils and massage without using hard pressure or trying to force the 
          body to change, which should never be done. 
         </p>

      <details class="faq">
        <summary class="question">What should I expect during session and preparation for treatment? </summary>
         <p class="answer">
          Prior to a Raindrop Therapy Session please hydrate and dress in comfortable clothes you do not mind getting oily -
          or bring a change of clothes for after your session. For the session, you will undress down to your underwear but if
          you prefer, you can wear a loose fitting or stretchy pant and keep them on. We also ask that you remove any jewellery, 
          the only exception is rings that you never take off. You will lie on our table, face up prior to the practitioner entering
          the room, and remain covered throughout the session. The essential oils are applied in a specific technique on both the feet 
          and spine; hot towel compresses will follow.  The process takes about 60 minutes, after which we recommend you rest for a
          few minutes while doing some deep breathing exercises before getting dressed. Rest and hydration are also recommended following
          your treatment.

      <details class="faq">
        <summary class="question">Will the oils leave my body feeling greasy? </summary>
         <p class="answer">
          No, these are pure essential oils and are not produced the same way that synthetic oils are produced. You will find the
          oils absorb into the skin so quickly, by the time the session is over you will not be able to tell we put any oils on you. 
          Even the V6 oil we use to dilute the other oils will be absorbed very quickly.

        <summary class="question"> What is Ionic Foot Bath and does it hurt? </summary>
         <p class="answer">
          An ionic foot bath combines water, salt and a small electrical current to produce charged ionic energy that helps promote
          detoxification. During the 30-minute session, the water in the bath changes color. This change in color is caused by the
          oxidation of the metal plates in the bath reacting with solutes in the water as toxins release from the body. 
          Not at all as the Ionic Footbath is completely non-invasive. Some report that a slight tingling sensation is felt in their 
          feet during the treatment.

      <details class="faq">
        <summary class="question">What should I expect during the Ionic Foot Bath session? </summary>
         <p class="answer">
          You will be asked to remove your shoes and socks and comfortably sit in a chair. Your feet will be placed in a tub filled with 
          warm water and salt. The practitioner will then add the array to the water. A small electrical current will be passed through the
          water, creating charged ionic energy that helps promote detoxification. As the session progresses, you may notice changes in the 
          color of the water due to the oxidation of metal plates and the release of toxins from your body. Some individuals may experience
          a slight tingling sensation in their feet as the electrical current interacts with their bodys electrolytes.  The session typically
          lasts around 30 minutes, during which you can relax and enjoy the treatment. After the foot bath, toxins will continue to flush out 
          of your body naturally over the next 24-48 hours through your lymphatic and excretory systems.
